# Ticker Case Studies

One file per closed trade arc. Designed for lazy loading — the index lists ticker, event, date, and key lesson; load full file only when needed.

## Index

| Ticker | Event | Date | Result | Key Lesson | File |
|--------|-------|------|--------|------------|------|
| INTC | Q1 2026 earnings | 2026-04-23 | profit (+$3.78 swing from flip) | Flip thesis when tape invalidates it | `intc-2026-04.md` |
| MSFT/GOOGL/AMZN | Q1 2026 cluster | 2026-04-29 | net profit despite one losing leg | Multi-name diversification absorbs single-thesis failure; LEAPS vega tax is real | `mag7-2026-q1.md` |
| APP | Q1 2026 earnings | 2026-05-06 | profit | Manipulator-tape → sell premium, scalp leveraged proxy, don't buy direction | `app-2026-05.md` |
| NOK | Q1 2026 + post-ER re-rate | 2026-04-23 (in-progress) | profit (+100% on Jun-27 LEAPS, ongoing exposure) | Post-earnings momentum continuation beats intraday-fade pattern when fundamentals + sector + flow align; elevated IV without near-term event is demand-driven, not event-driven | `nok-2026-04.md` |

## Quick Lookup by Pattern

- **Manipulator-tape + channel-check edge**: `app-2026-05.md`
- **Post-earnings momentum + sector co-rally + demand-IV**: `nok-2026-04.md`
- **Analyst error: gap-up fade misread / IV crush misread**: `nok-2026-04.md`
- **KOL amplification / thematic re-rate**: `nok-2026-04.md`

## Adding a New Case Study

1. Copy `_template.md` to `<ticker>-YYYY-MM.md`
2. Fill out frontmatter (`ticker`, `event`, `date`, `status`, `result`, `structures`, `tags`)
3. Document the trade arc — Setup, Strategy Evolution by stage, Outcome, What Worked, What Got Wrong, Lessons, Reusable Framework
4. Add row to the index above
5. If the case yields new pitfalls, add files under `../pitfalls/` and link them from this case study
